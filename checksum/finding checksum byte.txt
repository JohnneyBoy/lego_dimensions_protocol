Selection of packets that do the same thing.
Found by searching in the log for a substring of a given packet.
Assumptions used:
	Byte 3 is a counter
	One of the bytes is a checksum byte
	Section of log was colours looping through a sequence of colours in a fixed pattern.
The counter byte and checksum will thus be the only different parts of the packet.
After testing these packets  by sending them to the portal, these assumptions appear true.
The last non-zero byte appears to be the checksum.
From this observation it appears that the zero bytes after the checksum are padding.
