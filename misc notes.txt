Misc. notes:

Toy tags cannot be replaced by blank generic NTAG203 tags.
Toy tags contain a NDEF record, just like regular tags.

While waiting to program a toy tag, the gateway continually sends the UID of the tag on the center pad.


I was able to use the Portal addon without a network connection.
No online auth or level download was required.
On-disk DLC? :(
