NFC Notes

Wyldstyle tag dump excerpt:
Card UID: 04 9A 74 6A 0B 40 80
(This is one of the four tags used in the 2015-11-16 play session)


Portal device appears to only care about the UID of a tag, meaning homebrew tags are possible.
I suspect all the authentication is in the console where security, debugging, and patching are easy for the game devs.
(If they did it right, with unique tags and a lookup-table at their office to verify no cloning took place before content gets downloadewd for the expansion pack.)
(I expect tags are merely holding a product key similar to what steam uses.)
(Verify if the full tag is read on first read to see if we can use the same function to read tags)
Is there a way to read all the data from a tag? - Possible use as generic NFC card/tag reader?
Are there size limits if there is such a command?
