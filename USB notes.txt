Byte 0 always 0x55
Byte 1 always 0x14
Byte 2 always 0xc6
Byte 3 looks like a counter, changing it breaks the command though (Probably due to checksum)
Byte 4 always 01
Byte 5 always 1e
Byte 6 always 01
Byte 7 can change
Last non-zero byte is a checksum


Checksum byte:
	Last non-zero byte is a checksum
	Checksum is not:

HYPOTHESES:
	Protocol will start with a handshake
	Commands to change colour of pads will follow
	Colour values will consist of 3 sets of 3 byte RGB values. ex. [(0x00,0x00,0xff), (0x00,0x00,0xff), (0x00,0x00,0xff)]
	Colour values will persist until new values are sent or device is powered off.
